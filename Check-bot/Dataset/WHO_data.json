    "Answer": "There’s currently no evidence it can be. Coronaviruses are generally spread person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Before preparing or eating food, wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, or use hand sanitizer."
  },
  {
    "Context": "Can the virus spread through drinking water?",
    "Answer": "It hasn’t been detected in drinking water. Most water treatment methods should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19."
  },
  {
    "Context": "Will warm weather stop the COVID-19 outbreak?",
    "Answer": "There’s currently no evidence it can be. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold-weather months, but you can still get them during other months."
  },
  {
    "Context": "I’m not feeling well but I’m not sure I have COVID-19. What should I do?",
    "Answer": "The first thing you should do is contact your health care provider. If you don’t have a health care provider, call the closest urgent care center and find out if you can be seen there and how much it will cost. Beyond that, even if you feel fine it’s best to behave as if you have the virus and could spread it. That’s a great way to protect yourself and others."
  },
  {
    "Context": "I was feeling flu-like symptoms but am starting to feel better. Is there any way to tell for sure whether I had COVID-19?",
    "Answer": "There are now reports of several manufacturers who have developed a serology test, also called an immunity or antibody test. This checks for evidence that a person has developed a specific immune reaction that produced antibodies to fight the COVID-19 virus. Ideally, people with those specific antibodies are protected from getting ill once again from the COVID-19 virus."
  },
  {
    "Context": "I heard a rumor that my medication could put me at risk. Is that true?",
    "Answer": "The first thing you should do if you hear a rumor about your medication is contact your health care provider or pharmacist. There recently was misinformation going around about COVID-19 risks for patients who were already prescribed medications for high blood pressure, heart failure and other heart disease."
  },
  {
    "Context": "As an essential worker, how can I make sure I’m following the latest safety advice?",
    "Answer": "Keep checking the CDC’s site, which continually updates guidance for workers. And of course, follow the guidance of social distancing, regular hand-washing, cleaning and disinfecting workspaces, and wearing a mask or cloth face covering."
  },
  {
    "Context": "Is it safe to go to restaurants?",
    "Answer": "The general advice is to get carryout or delivery if you want restaurant food. Be sure to wash your hands with soap for 20 seconds before and after eating. (And any other time you realize you just haven’t washed your hands in a while.) You might consider washing the food containers."
  },
  {
    "Context": "I have all kinds of questions about whether it’s safe to travel. Where do I start?",
    "Answer": "You’re not alone. From cruise safety to airport worries, the CDC breaks down the guidance. In general, avoid discretionary or non-urgent travel."
  },
  {
    "Context": "Is it safe to go to the grocery store?",
    "Answer": "If you’re healthy and follow all the precautions, you should be able to go to the store. Just be extra careful and bear in mind there are a whole lot of surfaces and potential coughers and sneezers. Practice social distancing by staying at least six feet from others."
  },
  {
    "Context": "I like to walk and run outside. Is it still safe to go outside?",
    "Answer": "Yes, it’s still safe and advisable to go outside if you practice healthy social distancing. Given the physical and mental health benefits, please get out there and keep moving!"
